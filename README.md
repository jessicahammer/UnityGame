# UnityGame
To run this game in unity you need Version 2018.3.14f1

This is a litte endless run game for the creative coding class. It's based on a tutorial, that you can find here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0X4_zT5R_s&list=PL4UezTfGBADC6Li-b8uPptn1JsgFzUoXs&index=1 
I added some extra stuff like design, a pause menu and start and endscreen. 

There are still some bugs, that I couldn't fix yet:

**BUGS**
**Pause Menu**

1. Sometimes you have to press escape again after coming from pause menu to start the game.

2. Pause Menu doesn't work in level 2 (difficult).

**Stats**

Should be shown after failing - only works in unity itself sadly.

**Moreover**
 When you finish one level and go back to menu and start another level the camera doesn't move sometimes - you have to restart the game :/
