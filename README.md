# UnityGame
This is a litte endless run game for the creative coding class. It's based on a tutorial, that you can find here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0X4_zT5R_s&list=PL4UezTfGBADC6Li-b8uPptn1JsgFzUoXs&index=1 
I added some extra stuff like design, a pause menu and start and endscreen. 

There are still some bugs, that I couldn't fix yet:
1. If you play the game and switch from pause mode to difficult level the game sometimes doesn't move on - try to press escape to start rolling the ball.
2. When you finish one level and go back to menu and start another level the camera doesn't move.
